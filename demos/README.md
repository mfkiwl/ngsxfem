# Demonstrations

The python files in this directory provide several examples that demonstrate the usage of `ngsxfem` features. For an introduction to these features we refer to the [ngsxfem-jupyter tutorials](https://github.com/ngsxfem/ngsxfem-jupyter). In the next table you can see the available demonstration files and a short description:
